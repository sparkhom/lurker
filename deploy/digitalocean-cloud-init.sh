# Lurker — DigitalOcean one-shot deploy (cloud-init user-data)
# ============================================================
#
# Paste the ENTIRE contents of this file into the "User Scripts" field when
# creating a DigitalOcean droplet (under "Additional Options"). That field is
# DigitalOcean's label for cloud-init user data; older guides call it "User
# data" or "Startup scripts". On first boot the droplet will, with no SSH:
#
#   * install Docker + the Compose plugin (skipped if already present, so
#     this works on both the Docker Marketplace image and vanilla Ubuntu)
#   * fetch Lurker, front it with Caddy for automatic HTTPS (Let's Encrypt),
#     and start everything under Docker Compose
#   * configure passkeys and web push — HTTPS makes both possible, so the
#     instance comes up feature-complete with no post-install server admin
#   * add a small swapfile on low-RAM droplets and configure the firewall
#
# Everything is logged to /var/log/lurker-deploy.log — view that from the
# DigitalOcean droplet console if a deploy doesn't come up as expected.
#
# ─── Required: fill in BOTH values before pasting ───────────────────────────
#
# This deploy always serves Lurker over HTTPS. HTTPS isn't a nicety here — it
# is what makes passkeys, web push, and secure browser sessions work — so
# there is no plain-HTTP option, and both values below are required. The
# script aborts if either is left blank.

# The public domain Lurker will be served on, e.g. "irc.example.com".
# Caddy obtains a Let's Encrypt certificate for it automatically. Once the
# droplet exists, point a DNS A record for this domain at the droplet's IP
# (the deploy log prints it); Caddy keeps retrying until that record resolves.
LURKER_DOMAIN=""

# Your email address. It is used for two things, both of which need a real,
# reachable address: the Let's Encrypt certificate contact (renewal and
# expiry notices), and the contact embedded in web-push messages, which
# Apple, Google, and Mozilla's push services require.
ADMIN_EMAIL=""

# ─── Optional: built-in identd (RFC 1413) ───────────────────────────────────
#
# Set to "true" to run Lurker's built-in identd on port 113. For a MULTI-USER
# instance this lets IRC networks attribute each user individually behind the
# shared server IP (and is what networks like Libera ask of a hosted service) —
# users then appear with a verified ident rather than an unverified "~ident".
# The script publishes :113 and opens it in the firewall. Leave blank for a
# single-user instance that doesn't need it.
#
# Requires a Lurker image that includes identd (ghcr.io/amiantos/lurker:latest
# once that lands). Docker note: the :113 callback is matched against the full
# connection 4-tuple (both addresses + both ports), so the container has to see
# the IRC server's real source IP and the outbound connection's source port.
# Docker's default bridge (iptables DNAT) preserves both for external callbacks,
# so this works as-is. If you ever see unverified idents — under heavy
# concurrency (source-port reuse), or if your host routes :113 through the
# userland proxy so callbacks appear to come from the docker gateway — run the
# lurker service with `network_mode: host` instead, so the container shares the
# host's addresses directly. The cell logs `[identd] <ports> matched a live
# connection but query address <ip> did not` on every such mismatch, which is the
# signal to switch.
ENABLE_IDENTD=""
