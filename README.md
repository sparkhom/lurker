Lurker is a self-hosted modern IRC client with a retro flair, most easily described as "your personal [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com), with [Weechat](https://weechat.org) looks".

Lurker runs as an always-on server that stays connected to IRC on your behalf, keeps full message history, and lets you reattach from any browser — desktop or mobile — picking up exactly where you left off. Open it on as many devices and tabs as you like; read state, settings, and history stay in sync everywhere; when all clients are disconnected, auto-away sets your status, and web push notifications inform you of highlights. Oh, and the icon rules.

⚠️ *This project is under heavy development and some screens are not fully polished!* View the [project kanban](https://kanban.bradroot.me/projects/12/45#share-auth-token=heTq3lrceDTKVlNYHKTH6MPaDqA2pJowusiqETTL) to see what's coming soon. 

# Features
- **Always-on and multi-user.** Each invited user connects to their own set of IRC networks, and Lurker stays connected when they're away.
- **Full history and search.** Every message is stored *and* searchable. Auto-away triggers after your last client disconnects, and smart push notifications fire on highlights.
- **Modern IRC.** Peer presence, automatic nick regain, join/part summarization, tab nickname completion, and a searchable channel browser w/ cache.
- **Image uploads.** Paste, drag, or pick an image; Lurker optimizes it, uploads it to [x0.at](https://x0.at) or [catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe), inserts the link into your message, and keeps a history of all your uploads.
- **Customizable UI.** The beautiful retro terminal-style interface has 40+ settings to customize it how you want, and you can freely pin and rearrange channels and DMs.
- **Installable.** Lurker is a PWA — install it as a native-feeling app on your phone, Mac, or PC straight from the browser.
