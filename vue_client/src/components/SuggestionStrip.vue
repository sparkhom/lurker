<!--
  Generic horizontal suggestion strip rendered as a StatusBar overlay — the
  IRCCloud-style autocomplete bar. Same chrome as the bar it covers (so the
  bar visually disappears while the strip is up); keyboard-navigable via an
  externally-owned activeIndex so the host's keydown handler can drive it
  without an imperative ref.

  The strip is content-agnostic: callers pass an `items` array, a `keyFor`
  function, and the current `activeIndex`, and render each chip's body
  through the `chip` slot. Used by both the nick and emoji suggesters.
-->

<template>
  <div
    ref="rootEl"
    class="suggestion-strip"
    :class="{ visible: items.length > 0 }"
    @pointerdown.stop
    @mousedown.prevent.stop
  >
    <!-- iOS keyboard preservation:
         - Fire the action on `click` (end of the touch sequence). Emitting on
           pointerdown closes the strip *mid-touch*, so the subsequent mousedown
           lands on whatever's underneath (StatusBar) instead of this chip —
           defeating @mousedown.prevent and dismissing the soft keyboard.
         - @mousedown.prevent is the canonical iOS hook that prevents the
           browser from shifting focus away from the textarea on tap. It must
           fire on the chip itself, which is why the action moved to click.
         - Plain <div>, not <button>: a <button> is focusable, so iOS would
           still steal focus during the touch before mousedown.prevent runs. -->

// walks up the ancestor chain trying to satisfy both axes; even though the
// strip is `overflow-y: hidden`, the vertical axis still resolves against
// the next scrollable ancestor (the message area / document), which yanks
// the page up by ~1px when the chip's box doesn't line up perfectly with
// the viewport. Restricting the operation to the strip's own scrollLeft
// keeps the motion purely horizontal.
