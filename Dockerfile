# Stage 2: Install server dependencies
#
# Using debian-slim (glibc) rather than alpine (musl) so better-sqlite3 and
# sharp can install from their published linux-x64 / linux-arm64 prebuilds
# instead of compiling from source. Compiling native modules under QEMU when
# multi-arch building on a single-arch GHA runner is glacial (or hangs
# outright), and the prebuild path sidesteps it entirely.
#
# Pinned to node:22 specifically (rather than lts) because better-sqlite3
# 11.x ships prebuilds for Node 22 but not Node 24 (which the lts tag
# currently resolves to). Bump when better-sqlite3 catches up.
