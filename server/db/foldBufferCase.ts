// Case-fold repair for forked buffers (#268 channels, #289/#327 generalization).
//
// IRC targets are case-insensitive, but some servers relay a different case than
// the one we joined/opened with (DALnet's registered #Christian vs the
// #christian we joined; a DM peer presented as `bob` vs the `Bob` we /query'd).
// Buffers used to key by exact case, so a stray case forked a second,
// metadata-less buffer with state split across the two casings. The live paths
// now fold case (canonicalChannelTarget server-side; the buffers store
// client-side), but already-forked rows linger in the DB across every
// target-keyed table.
//
// This is the one repair routine, shared by:
//   - the schema-version-9 one-shot migration (server/db/index.ts), scope 'all'
//     — merges every forked buffer (channels and DMs) when a DB upgrades past
//     v9; and
//   - the manual `tools/fold-buffer-case.ts` operator script — a re-runnable
//     fallback (scope 'all' by default, --channels-only to narrow) for forks
//     that appear after the migration already ran.
//
// Canonical case = the variant carrying the most messages (the buffer you
// actually used = the case you joined/opened with), ties broken by `target ASC`
// purely for determinism. A target that never drifted (a single case) maps to
// itself and is left untouched, so #idleRPG stays #idleRPG. The flat ':'-virtual
// buffers (`:server:`, `:friends:`…) are never folded. Composite-PK tables merge
// conflict-aware (furthest read pointer + clear marker, joined flag, junk-close
// dropped). The whole apply runs in one transaction; dryRun computes the same
// report without mutating.

// The schema version this fold was last audited against. The schema-version-9
// migration in index.ts calls foldBufferCase mid-upgrade (before the version row
// is written), so it can't be gated — but the manual operator script refuses to
// run unless the DB sits exactly here. A future migration that adds or reshapes
// a buffer-keyed table must re-check TARGET_TABLES (and the channels/buffer_reads
// merges) below, then deliberately bump this in lockstep with SCHEMA_VERSION in
// index.ts — so the script can never silently fold an out-of-date table set.
