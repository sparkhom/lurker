// Persistence for the DCC download manager (#270) — one row per inbound DCC
// transfer. The IRC connection lives on the cell, so received bytes land on disk
// at destination_path while this row tracks the transfer's lifecycle for the
// download-manager UI and survives a cell restart (so a stalled transfer can be
// resumed). Nothing here touches the message tables.

import db from './index.js';

// The download-manager state machine. Two entry states:
//   - `requested`: we sent an XDCC trigger and armed acceptance for the bot's
//     reply (phase 1). Survives a slow bot queue — the row just waits.
//   - `pending_approval`: an UNSOLICITED offer awaiting the user's Accept/Reject
//     (phase 2). Phase 0 records every detected offer here, since arming doesn't
//     exist yet and nothing may auto-land.
// From an accepted offer the flow is connecting → receiving → (stalled, on a
// dropped connection or restart) → verifying → completed; or it ends
// failed / rejected / cancelled. Kept as a TS union + a TEXT column (matching the
// repo's other enum columns, e.g. peer_presence_state.state) rather than a DB
// CHECK, so the allowed values live in one documented place.
