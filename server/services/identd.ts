// A minimal built-in identd (RFC 1413). When a multi-user Lurker connects many
// users to a network from one IP, the network can't tell them apart unless an
// identd vouches for each connection's ident. This server answers the IRC
// server's port-113 callback by mapping the connection's *local source port* to
// the ident Lurker registered for it (see ircConnection.ts).
//
// Opt-in via LURKER_IDENTD_ENABLED — binding :113 is privileged and most
// single-user self-hosts don't need it; the hosted (node) edition turns it on
// per cell. Mirrors The Lounge's built-in identd: to avoid running as root you
// can set LURKER_IDENTD_PORT to a high port and have the host's oidentd forward
// to it (:113 must be reachable by the IRC server either way).

//     verified, and there's no fallback that wouldn't reopen :113 enumeration.
