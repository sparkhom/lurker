// The active-DCC receive engine (#270, phase 1): one TCP socket → one file on
// disk. The cell has a public IP, so for a standard XDCC bot we dial out to the
// address/port in its DCC SEND offer (the common case) and stream the bytes to
// destPath, sending the DCC 4-byte cumulative ACK back so ACK-gated senders keep
// going. Deliberately IRC-free and DB-free: the caller (ircConnection) owns the
// dcc_transfers row and throttles its writes — this just moves bytes and reports
// progress via callbacks. Passive/reverse DCC (we listen) and RESUME come later.
//
// References for the wire details (see ~/Coding/irc-clients): irssi
// src/irc/dcc/dcc-get.c and WeeChat src/plugins/xfer/xfer-dcc.c — the 4-byte
// big-endian ACK (wrapping past 4 GiB) and "done when received >= advertised
// size" completion rule.
